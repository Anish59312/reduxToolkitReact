redux-toolkit is combination of various libraries that made configuration of redux easier

redux in react is used with react-redux library

store banao
make a **slice** which has intialstate and a function to change the state - called reducer

there can be multipler reducers

export individual reducers
also export the slice.reducer

now work with jsx page

to call these reducers use useDispatch and useSelector in jsx page

useSelector has access to current state and thus used in reading operations
